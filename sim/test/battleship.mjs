// Battleship: 1v1 with a placement phase, hidden fleets, and shoot-again-on-hit.
// Exercises the shared challenge/accept flow, manual placement (valid + rejected),
// firing (hit keeps the turn, miss passes it), the sunk toast, the win, forfeit on
// leave, rematch, and -- most importantly -- that a player's view never exposes an
// un-hit enemy ship cell (hidden information). Drives the real engine headless.
