# Hotspot Arcade — wire protocols

Two links, two protocols. This file is the source of truth; the Flipper app, the
ESP32 firmware, and the web client must all agree with it.

```
 Flipper Zero  <--- UART v2 (framed) --->  ESP32-S2  <--- WebSocket (JSON) --->  Phones
  host brain                                referee                               players
```

- **UART v2** carries only low-frequency session/meta traffic (asset upload, AP
  control, round orchestration, join/leave, score deltas). Never per-frame state.
- **WebSocket JSON** carries the real-time game traffic, local to the ESP.

---

## 1. UART v2 (Flipper <-> ESP32)

- **115200-safe wiring, run at 921600 8N1** on the Flipper GPIO USART (pins 13/14).
  Fallback 460800 if the trace is noisy. Baud is a build constant on both sides.
- Same expansion-service dance as flytrap: `expansion_disable()` **before**
  `furi_hal_serial_control_acquire()`, `expansion_enable()` after release.

### 1.1 Control frame

All control messages are framed so the link can resync after noise:

```
+------+------+---------+-----------------+------+
| SYNC | TYPE | LEN(2)  | PAYLOAD(LEN)    | CRC8 |
+------+------+---------+-----------------+------+
 0xA5    1B    LE u16     LEN bytes         1B
```

- `SYNC = 0xA5`.
- `TYPE` = one of the message types below.
- `LEN` = payload length, little-endian u16 (0..4096). Payloads are capped at
  **4096** bytes; larger data (asset files) uses the raw-bulk escape (1.3).
- `CRC8` = CRC-8/ATM (poly 0x07, init 0x00) over `TYPE || LEN || PAYLOAD`.
- On a bad CRC or unknown type, the receiver drops the frame and rescans for the
  next `0xA5`.

### 1.2 Message types

**Flipper -> ESP**

| Type | Name         | Payload |
|------|--------------|---------|
| 0x10 | CLEAR_FILES  | (none) — drop all stored assets, start of session |
| 0x11 | FILE_BEGIN   | `flags(1)` `pathlen(1)` `path` `mimelen(1)` `mime` `total(4 LE)` — then `total` **raw** bytes follow (see 1.3). `flags` bit0 = gzip. |
| 0x12 | SET_AP       | `ssid` (UTF-8, <=32B) |
| 0x13 | START        | (none) — bring up AP + DNS + HTTP + WS |
| 0x14 | STOP         | (none) |
| 0x15 | RESET        | (none) — ESP reboots |
| 0x16 | SELECT_GAME  | `gameid(1)` — 0 lobby, 1 trivia, 2 connect4 |
| 0x17 | QUESTION     | JSON: `{"i":<n>,"q":"..","o":["a","b","c","d"],"c":<0-3>,"dur":<sec>}` (trivia) |
| 0x18 | REVEAL       | (none) — close the current question, broadcast the correct answer |
| 0x19 | ROUND_END    | (none) — back to lobby for the active game |
| 0x1A | CONFIG       | JSON: `{"max":8,"lang":"pt-br"}` — station cap and the host's phone-UI language (`""`/absent = English). The ESP stores `lang` and echoes it back in each `welcome`. |
| 0x1B | RESET_SCORES | (none) — zero the ESP live score mirror |
| 0x1C | CONTENT_CLEAR | (none) — drop all packs, for every game |
| 0x1D | CONTENT_PACK | game byte + pack name — begin a pack for that game |
| 0x1E | CONTENT_ITEM | JSON object of the file's own keys — append one item to the current pack |

> Content is opaque to the Flipper. It parses only `Key: value` blocks and ships them
> verbatim; every game's interpretation of those keys lives in the ESP firmware, so a new
> content game needs no protocol change. Per-game item shapes (no new opcodes, just what
> the ESP expects in each `CONTENT_ITEM` JSON object): trivia `{q,a,b,c,d,answer}`, wyr
> `{a,b}` (the two options), scramble and draw `{word}` (a single plain word).
>
> Content **language** is resolved entirely on the Flipper: for the host's chosen `lang`
> it streams `packs/<game>/<lang>/` (falling back to the English packs at `packs/<game>/`
> per game), so the wire opcodes above are language-agnostic. Item text is UTF-8.

**ESP -> Flipper**

| Type | Name         | Payload |
|------|--------------|---------|
| 0x80 | STATUS       | token: `boot` `files_ok` `ap_ok` `up ip=..` `stopped` `err ..` |
| 0x81 | JOIN         | `pid(1)` `nick` — a player joined |
| 0x82 | LEAVE        | `pid(1)` |
| 0x83 | SCORE        | `pid(1)` `delta(2 LE, signed)` `reason` — authoritative-persist on Flipper |
| 0x84 | ROUND_RESULT | JSON, game-specific (trivia: `{"correct":[pid..]}`, c4: `{"win":pid,"lose":pid}` or `{"draw":[a,b]}`) |
| 0x85 | EVENT        | JSON for host display, e.g. `{"answers":3,"total":5}` or `{"c4":"A vs B started"}` |
| 0x86 | PING         | identity beacon ~every 2s: `magic(4)` + `version(2 LE)`. `magic` = `48 41 52 43` ("HARC"); the Flipper only treats a magic-matched PING as "our board present", and flags `version < HA_FW_VERSION` as an outdated board to update. |
| 0x87 | ART          | finished artwork, streamed: `op(1)` + JSON. `op` 0 = begin a sheet (`{"game":"frankendraw","id":n,"w0":"..","w1":"..","w2":".."}` — the three panels' drawers), 1 = one line segment (`{"p":panel,"x0":..,"y0":..,"x1":..,"y1":..}`, 0..255 sheet units), 2 = end (`{"id":n}`). One frame per segment: the picture is streamed as it is finished, so neither side ever buffers a drawing. The Flipper writes each sheet to `/ext/apps_data/hotspot_arcade/art/fd-<YYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<n>.svg`. |

### 1.3 Raw-bulk escape (asset upload)

`FILE_BEGIN` is a normal control frame; immediately after its CRC, the sender
writes exactly `total` **unframed** bytes (the file content, possibly gzipped).
The receiver switches to a raw-read state, counts down `total`, stores the bytes,
then returns to frame parsing. This mirrors flytrap's `sethtml <N>\n` + N bytes,
generalized to named files. Bulk bytes need no escaping because the length is known.

### 1.4 Handshake (session start)

```
Flipper                         ESP
  |-- CLEAR_FILES -------------->|
  |-- FILE_BEGIN + bytes (xN) -->|   (index.html.gz, app.js.gz, app.css.gz, ...)
  |-- SET_AP ------------------->|
  |-- START -------------------->|
  |<------------- STATUS ap_ok --|
  |<------------- STATUS up ip=..|   AP live, phones can join
```
Then live: JOIN/LEAVE/SCORE/EVENT/ROUND_RESULT flow up; SELECT_GAME/QUESTION/
REVEAL/ROUND_END flow down as the host drives rounds. PING beacons throughout.

---

## 2. WebSocket JSON (Phone <-> ESP32)

- Endpoint: `ws://192.168.4.1/ws`. One socket per phone.
- All messages are a single JSON object with a `t` (type) field. Small; one frame.
- The ESP is authoritative: clients render server state and send intents only.

### 2.1 Client -> Server

| `t`        | Fields | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `hello`    | `nick` | Join / re-join with a nickname (from localStorage) |
| `answer`   | `c` (0-3) | Trivia: buzz an answer for the current question |
| `challenge`| `to` (pid) | Connect4: challenge a player in the lobby |
| `accept`   | `from` (pid) | Connect4: accept a pending challenge |
| `cancel`   | | Connect4: withdraw my challenge / decline |
| `move`     | `col` (0-6) | Connect4: drop a disc in a column |
| `leaveGame`| | Connect4: forfeit/exit the current match |
| `ping`     | | keepalive |

### 2.2 Server -> Client

| `t`      | Fields | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `welcome`| `pid`, `nick`, `lang` | Assigned player id after `hello`; `lang` is the host's phone-UI language (`""` = English), which the client uses to pick its message catalog |
| `lobby`  | `game` ("none"/"trivia"/"connect4"), `players` (`[{pid,nick,score}]`), `me` (pid) | Lobby snapshot; sent on change |
| `trivia` | `phase` ("idle"/"question"/"reveal"), `i`, `q`, `o` (opts), `dur`, `deadline` (ms epoch-ish, server `millis`), `mine` (my choice or -1), `counts` ([n0..n3]), `correct` (reveal only), `scores` | Full trivia view for this client |
| `c4`     | `phase` ("lobby"/"playing"/"over"), lobby: `challenges` (`[{from,to}]`); playing: `mid`, `board` (42 ints: 0 empty/1/2), `turn` (pid), `me` (1 or 2), `opp` (nick), `you` (pid); over: `result` ("win"/"lose"/"draw") | Full connect4 view for this client |
| `toast`  | `msg` | Transient message to show |
| `pong`   | | keepalive reply |

Server `millis` is used for `deadline`; the client shows a countdown from
`deadline - now_estimate`, so exact clock sync is not required (the server is the
referee for scoring; the client bar is cosmetic).

### 2.3 Scoring split

The ESP scores the live session (speed+correctness for trivia, win/draw for c4)
and (a) keeps a **live mirror** it broadcasts to phones in `players[].score`, and
(b) reports each delta to the Flipper via UART `SCORE` for the host display and
persistent leaderboard. Both stay consistent because every delta is reported.

---

## 3. v0.2 game expansion

New game ids (UART `SELECT_GAME` / lobby `game`): `3` tictactoe, `4` dots,
`5` draw, `6` pong. Lobby `game` string adds: `"tictactoe"`, `"dots"`, `"draw"`,
`"pong"`.

### 3.1 Duels (connect4, tictactoe, dots) — unified

All three are 1v1 and share the same lobby flow. Client intents:
`challenge{to}`, `accept{from}`, `cancel`, `move{n}`, `rematch`, `leaveGame`.
`move.n` is a grid index whose meaning depends on `kind` (below). `rematch` in an
`over` match restarts the same pairing (first move alternates) if the opponent is
still present.

Server -> client message `t:"duel"`, common fields: `kind`
("c4"/"ttt"/"dots"), `phase` ("lobby"/"playing"/"over"), `you` (pid), `me`
(1 or 2), `opp` (nick), `turn` (pid), `result` ("win"/"lose"/"draw", over only),
`challenges` (`[{from,to}]`, lobby only).

- **c4** (`kind:"c4"`): `cols:7`, `rows:6`, `need:4`, `gravity:true`, `board`
  (42 ints, row-major, row 0 top, 0/1/2). `move.n` = column 0..6.
- **ttt** (`kind:"ttt"`): `cols:3`, `rows:3`, `need:3`, `gravity:false`, `board`
  (9 ints). `move.n` = cell 0..8.
- **dots** (`kind:"dots"`): boxes grid `w`,`h` (e.g. 5x5 boxes). `hedges`
  (`(h+1)*w` ints 0/1 = drawn), `vedges` (`h*(w+1)` ints), `boxes`
  (`w*h` ints 0/1/2 = owner). `sme`,`sopp` (box counts). `move.n` = edge index:
  horizontal edges `0..(h+1)*w-1` then vertical edges after. Completing a box
  grants another turn.

### 3.2 Drawing + guessing (`draw`)

Host selects the game; the ESP runs rounds off its built-in word list, rotating
the drawer. Server -> client `t:"draw"`:
- `phase:"draw"`, `role:"drawer"`: `word`, `round`, `drawer` (pid), `scores`.
- `phase:"draw"`, `role:"guesser"`: `len` (word length), `round`, `drawer`
  (nick), `scores`.
- `phase:"reveal"`: `word`, `winner` (pid or null), `scores`.
- `phase:"idle"`: `scores`.

Ink: the drawer sends line segments `stroke{x0,y0,x1,y1}` (normalized 0..1) and
`clear{}`; the server relays to guessers as `ink{x0,y0,x1,y1}` / `ink{clear:true}`.
Guessing: a guesser sends `guess{text}`; a correct guess (case-insensitive) scores
and ends the round; a wrong guess is broadcast as `chat{nick,text}`.

### 3.3 Pong (`pong`)

1v1 via the same `challenge`/`accept`/`cancel`/`leaveGame` flow. Real-time: the
ESP ticks the ball + paddles and broadcasts. Server -> client `t:"pong"`:
`phase` ("lobby"/"playing"/"over"), `challenges` (lobby); playing: `you`, `me`
(1/2), `opp`, `ball{x,y}` (0..1), `p1`, `p2` (paddle y, 0..1), `s1`, `s2`
(scores); over: `result`. Client input: `paddle{dir}` with `dir` -1/0/1.

### 3.4 Trivia depth (additive)

The in-question `EVENT` (ESP -> Flipper) gains a `counts` array so the host screen
can show live per-option bars: `{"answers":n,"total":m,"counts":[c0,c1,c2,c3]}`.
The final podium is Flipper-side (from its roster scores); no new message.

### 3.5 Notes

- Only one game is active at a time (host-selected), so the duel lobby/challenge
  machinery is shared and parameterized by the active `kind`.
- `move` unifies to `{t:"move","n":<index>}` for every duel (connect4 included;
  it previously used `col`).

---

## 4. v0.2.0 — identity, reactions, four more games

New game ids (UART `SELECT_GAME` / lobby `game`): `7` react, `8` wyr, `9`
scramble, `10` reversi. Lobby `game` string adds `"react"`, `"wyr"`,
`"scramble"`, `"reversi"`. Firmware **v6** (`HA_FW_VERSION`).

### 4.1 Player identity + reactions

- `hello` gains an optional `avatar` field (an emoji, UTF-8, default 🙂). Every
  player object in `players`/leaderboard/podium messages now carries `avatar`.
- New client intent `react{emoji}`. The ESP broadcasts it to everyone as a
  **distinct** type `{"t":"emoji","pid","nick","avatar","emoji"}` (not `react`,
  which is the reaction-duel game state — see below).
- New client intent `say{text}` broadcasts a lobby/draw chat line as
  `{"t":"chat","nick","text"}` (the server echoes it back, so clients never render
  their own locally).

### 4.2 Reversi / Othello (`kind:"reversi"`)

A fourth duel on the shared challenge/accept/rematch flow. `cols:8`, `rows:8`,
`board` (64 ints, row-major, 0 empty / 1 / 2). `move.n` = cell 0..63; only cells
that flank and flip at least one opponent disc are legal. Extra fields: `sme`,
`sopp` (disc counts) and `valid` (array of legal cell indices for the player to
move, so the client can hint them). The ESP auto-passes a player with no legal
move and ends the game — most discs wins — when neither can move.

### 4.3 Whole-group party games

Three self-organizing games share a lobby -> countdown -> round -> reveal ->
final flow. Common client intents: `ready{ready:bool}` (ready-up in the lobby),
`again` (replay from the final screen). Common server phases: `"lobby"`
(`players:[{pid,nick,avatar,ready}]`), `"countdown"` (`sec`), and `"final"`.
Durations are sent in **seconds**; deadlines in ms (server `millis`).

- **Would You Rather** (`t:"wyr"`): `"vote"`/`"reveal"` carry `round`, `rounds`,
  `a`, `b` (the two options), `myvote` (0/1/-1), `counts` ([a,b]). Vote with the
  existing `answer{c:0|1}` intent. No scoring — it's a poll.
- **Word Scramble** (`t:"scramble"`): `"play"` carries `round`, `rounds`, `scram`
  (shuffled letters), `len`, `solved` (bool, you), `deadline`, `dur`, `scores`.
  Guess with the existing `guess{text}` intent; first correct scores most
  (200/120/80/40). `"reveal"` carries `word`; `"final"` a `board` podium.
- **Reaction Duel** (`t:"react"`): `"armed"` carries `round`, `rounds`, `light`
  ("wait"/"go"), `dq`, `tapped`, `scores`. Tap with the new `tap` intent; the
  first valid tap after `light:"go"` wins (200), tapping while `"wait"` DQs you
  for the round. `"reveal"` carries `winner` (nick or null), `ms`, `iwon`;
  `"final"` a `board` podium.

## 5. Guess the Color (`gc`) — game id `11`

Whole-group round game on the same `Party` skeleton (`lobby -> countdown -> play
-> reveal -> ... -> final`, 5 rounds). Select with UART `SELECT_GAME` id `11`;
lobby `game` string is `"gc"`. Firmware **v12**.

Client intents: `ready{ready:bool}` (lobby), `again` (from final), and
`guess{r,g,b}` (submit your color, each 0-255). The `guess` type is shared with
draw/scramble, which send `guess{text}`; the ESP routes by which fields are present.

Server `{t:"gc",phase,...}`:
- `"play"`: `round`, `rounds`, `color` (`"#RRGGBB"`, the target swatch to match —
  the numeric answer is hidden), `submitted` (bool, you), `scores`.
- `"reveal"`: `round`, `rounds`, `r`,`g`,`b` (the true color), `color`, `your`
  (`{r,g,b,color,dist,points}` or null if you didn't guess), `winner` (nick or
  null), `iwon`, `scores`.
- `"final"`: `board` (podium).

Scoring per round: `points = closeness + speed_bonus`, where
`closeness = round(200 * (1 - dist/441.67))` clamped ≥ 0 (`dist` = Euclidean RGB
distance) and `speed_bonus = round(100 * (1 - submit_ms/12000))` clamped ≥ 0.
The round winner is the highest points (ties broken by the faster submit).

## 6. Battleship (`bs`) — game id `12`

A 1v1 match game (like Pong): shares the challenge/lobby flow (`challenge`/`accept`/
`cancel`, `rematch`, `leaveGame`) but has its own state and screen. 10x10 grid, five ships
(5,4,3,3,2 = 17 cells). Select with UART `SELECT_GAME` id `12`; lobby `game` string `"bs"`.
Firmware **v13**.

Client intents (besides the shared match ones): `place{ships}` and `fire{n}`.
- `place{ships}`: `ships` is a string `"r,c,d;r,c,d;..."`, one triple per ship in fixed
  order (5,4,3,3,2); `d`=0 horizontal, `d`=1 vertical (anchor is the top/left cell). The
  server reconstructs the cells, validates bounds and no-overlap, stores the fleet, and
  marks the player ready. Invalid layouts get a `toast` and no ready. Both ready -> firing.
- `fire{n}` (0..99): a hit keeps your turn (shoot again); a miss passes it. Sinking a ship
  sends a `toast` to both players.

Server `{t:"bs",phase,...}`:
- `"place"`: `you`, `me` (1/2), `opp`, `ready`, `oppReady`. The client renders its own board.
- `"fire"`: `turn`, `yourTurn`, `opp`, `myShips`, `oppShips`, and two 100-cell arrays:
  `mine` (your fleet: 0 empty, 1 ship, 2 miss, 3 hit) and `track` (your shots on the enemy:
  0 un-shot, 1 miss, 2 hit, 3 hit+sunk).
- `"over"`: adds `result` (win/lose) and `oppFleet` (the enemy fleet revealed).

**Hidden information:** `track` is derived only from the shots you've fired, so an enemy
ship cell you haven't hit is never in the payload. `oppFleet` appears only in `"over"`.

## 7. Spectrum (`spectrum`) — game id `13`

A whole-group party game (Wavelength-style) on the shared party skeleton (lobby with a
ready-up + pack vote, countdown, reveal). Content reuses the pack pipeline: each item is a
`Left`/`Right` word pair. Select with UART `SELECT_GAME` id `13`; lobby `game` string
`"spectrum"`. Firmware **v14**.

Each round rotates a **psychic** who sees a hidden target on a 0-100 spectrum and types a
clue; everyone else slides a dial to guess. Points by closeness (±2 = 4, ±7 = 3, ±12 = 2),
and the psychic earns the guessers' average, so a good clue pays off. Six rounds.

Client intents: `ready`, `vote{pack}`, `clue{text}` (psychic only), `slide{n}` (0..100,
guessers only), `again`.

Server `{t:"spectrum",phase,...}`:
- `"lobby"`: `you`, `players`, `packs` (name/votes), `myvote`.
- `"countdown"`: `sec`.
- `"play"` with `stage` `"clue"` | `"guess"` | `"reveal"`: `round`, `rounds`, `left`,
  `right`, `psychic` (nick), `iam` (am I the psychic), `deadline`/`dur` for the timer bar.
  - `target` (0..100) is sent **only to the psychic** during clue/guess, and to everyone on
    reveal — an un-revealed target never reaches a guesser.
  - `clue` appears once the psychic has submitted; `myguess` is the guesser's own locked value.
  - reveal adds `guesses` (`nick`/`g`/`pts`) and `mygain`.
- `"final"`: `board` (the shared leaderboard).

## 8. Kiss Marry Kill (`kmk`) — game id `14`

A whole-group party game on the shared party skeleton (lobby with a ready-up + pack vote,
countdown, reveal). Content reuses the pack pipeline: each item is a `Name` (one person or
character). Select with UART `SELECT_GAME` id `14`; lobby `game` string `"kmk"`. Firmware
**v15**.

Each round rotates a **chooser** and draws three people from the pack. The chooser secretly
assigns Kiss / Marry / Kill; everyone else predicts that assignment. Points are the number
of matching positions (0, 1, or 3 — matching two forces the third), and the chooser earns
the guessers' average. Six rounds.

Client intents: `ready`, `vote{pack}`, `assign{kiss,marry,kill}` (each is the 0-2 index of
the person getting that label; the chooser sends it in the choose stage, guessers in the
guess stage), `again`.

Server `{t:"kmk",phase,...}`:
- `"lobby"`: `you`, `players`, `packs` (name/votes), `myvote`.
- `"countdown"`: `sec`.
- `"play"` with `stage` `"choose"` | `"guess"` | `"reveal"`: `round`, `rounds`, `chooser`
  (nick), `iam` (am I the chooser), `people` (the three names), `deadline`/`dur` for the timer.
  - `answer` (the chooser's Kiss/Marry/Kill labels) is sent **only to the chooser** from the
    guess stage on, and to everyone on reveal — a guesser never sees it early.
  - `mine` is the guesser's own submitted labels.
  - reveal adds `guesses` (`nick`/labels/`pts`) and `mygain`.
- `"final"`: `board` (the shared leaderboard).

## 9. Chess (`chess`) — game id `15`

A 1v1 duel (like Pong/Battleship): shares the challenge/lobby flow (`challenge`/`accept`/
`cancel`, `rematch`, `leaveGame`) but plays full FIDE rules, refereed entirely on the ESP.
Select with UART `SELECT_GAME` id `15`; lobby `game` string `"chess"`. Firmware **v17**.
Chess has no content packs — its UI strings are localized client-side from the message
catalog like every game (the host's `lang`, set via `CONFIG` and echoed in `welcome`); the
per-language `packs/<game>/<lang>/` streaming that content games use does not apply here.

Client intents (besides the shared match ones): `move{from,to[,promo]}`, `resign`, `draw`
(offer, or accept one already pending), `claim`.
- `move{from,to,promo}`: squares are 0-63, `a1 = 0` row-major (`h8 = 63`). `promo` is
  required exactly when the move lands a pawn on the last rank — `2` knight, `3` bishop,
  `4` rook, `5` queen — and must be omitted/0 otherwise; a mismatched, illegal, or
  malformed move is silently ignored.
- `resign`: forfeit the game immediately.
- `draw`: offers a draw if none is pending; if the opponent already offered, accepts it and
  ends the game as a draw. The opponent gets a `toast` when an offer arrives.
- `claim`: claims a draw when threefold repetition or the 50-move count currently stands
  for the player to move; a no-op otherwise.

Server `{t:"chess",phase,...}`:
- `"playing"`: `you`, `opp`, `white` (bool, are you playing white), `turn` (pid),
  `yourTurn`, `board` (64 chars, index 0 = a1, row-major to h8: `PNBRQK`/`pnbrqk`/`.`),
  `moves` (`[from*64+to, ...]`, your legal moves, always present but populated only for the player to move), `check`,
  `last` (`from*64+to` of the last move played, `-1` before the first), `deadline`, `run`,
  `oms`, `wtm`, `claim3`, `claim50`, `offer` (`0` or the pid with a pending draw offer).
- `"over"`: the same fields minus `moves`/`claim3`/`claim50`, plus `result`
  (`"win"`/`"lose"`/`"draw"`) and `reason` (`mate`/`stalemate`/`resign`/`flag`/`flagdraw`/
  `material`/`rep3`/`rep5`/`move50`/`move75`/`agree`/`left`). **Quirk:** the server keeps
  recomputing `deadline` off the current time even after the game ends, so clients must
  read the clocks from `run`/`oms` (which the server does freeze on finish) rather than
  animate a countdown from `deadline` here. `offer` is also stale in this phase — it is not
  cleared when the game ends — so clients should ignore it once `phase` is `"over"`.
- `"lobby"`: `challenges` only.

Clocks: fixed 5+0 blitz, no increment, server-authoritative. `run` is the milliseconds left
on the clock of the side to move (`wtm` = white to move) and `oms` is the other side's
frozen remaining time; `deadline` is the server's `now + run`, so the client animates a
countdown without needing clock sync (same pattern as the other timed games). A flag fall
loses the game for the side whose clock ran out, unless the opponent could not mate by any
legal sequence (FIDE 6.9), in which case it's a draw (`flagdraw`).

Draw rules: stalemate, dead position (insufficient material), fivefold repetition, and the
75-move rule end the game automatically; threefold repetition and the 50-move rule are
claimable only by the player to move, via `claim`, exactly while `claim3`/`claim50` reads
true; either player can also offer or accept a draw via `draw`. A pending offer lapses the
moment either side plays a move.

State is pushed only on events — a move, resign, draw, claim, or a flag fall the ESP
notices on its own clock tick — never on a periodic heartbeat; clients animate the
countdown locally between pushes from `deadline`.

## 10. Frankendraw (`frankendraw`) — game id `20`

The exquisite-corpse drawing game, on the shared party skeleton (ready-up lobby,
countdown, final podium) but with its own three-round body. Select with UART
`SELECT_GAME` id `20`; lobby `game` string `"frankendraw"`. Firmware **v18**. No content
packs — its UI strings are localized client-side from the message catalog.

Everyone starts a sheet and everyone draws **at the same time**: round 1 the head, round
2 the torso, round 3 the legs, 75 seconds each (the round ends early once every player
has tapped Done). Between rounds the sheets **rotate one seat**, so each sheet is drawn
by three different players. Minimum three players.

**Sheet geometry.** A sheet is a `unit` x `unit` grid (255) split into three equal
`band`s of 85; panel *p* owns `[p*band, p*band+band]`. Strokes go up as the same
`{t:"stroke",x0,y0,x1,y1}` Draw & Guess uses — normalised 0..1 over the whole sheet — and
the server quantises them onto the grid and clamps both endpoints into the sender's own
band. Ink comes back down in grid units, as flat `[x0,y0,x1,y1, ...]` arrays.

**What a drawer may see.** During a round the server sends a drawer exactly one thing:
the bottom `over` units (7, about 8% of a band) of the panel **directly above theirs**,
on the sheet **currently in their hands**. A segment is only included if *both* its
endpoints sit at or below that line, so a stroke that merely dips into the sliver cannot
drag its other end down with it. Nothing else is serialised — not the rest of that panel,
not the panel below, not any other sheet — and a drawer's own strokes are never echoed
back to them. Nothing is relayed live between players at all.

**Rotation, joining and leaving.** Seats are frozen when the game starts (everyone
connected then, in pid order). In round *r*, seat *k* holds sheet `(k + seats - (r-1)) %
seats`. Joining mid-game gets no seat (`panel:-1`, `wait:true`) and plays from the next
game. Leaving vacates the seat for the rest of the game: the sheet in that player's hands
is **not** reassigned — everybody still playing is already holding a sheet, so handing it
on would mean drawing two panels at once — it simply rotates on to its next scheduled
holder, leaving that one panel blank. A panel is credited to whoever held it when the
round started.

**Scoring.** The game has no winner of its own, so the ending is a vote: after the
gallery every player picks a favourite creature, each vote pays 100 points to each of
that sheet's three contributors, and the most-voted sheet is crowned on the final screen.
With exactly three players every sheet has the same three contributors, so the podium is
flat by construction and the crowned creature is the result.

Client intents: `ready`, `stroke{x0,y0,x1,y1}`, `clear` (wipes only your own panel),
`done`, `vote{sheet}` (accepted throughout the gallery and the vote stage; the last one
counts), `again`.

Server `{t:"frankendraw",phase,...}`:
- `"lobby"`: `you`, `players`, `need` (3).
- `"countdown"`: `sec`.
- `"draw"`: `round`, `rounds` (3), `unit`, `band`, `over`, `deadline`/`dur`, `scores`,
  and per player either `panel:-1`/`wait:true` (no seat) or `panel`, `top`, `bot`,
  `sheet`, `done`, `waiting` (how many are still drawing) and `ink` (the sliver above).
- `"show"`: the gallery, one finished sheet at a time — `n`, `total`, `unit`, `band`,
  `who` (the three drawers, `""` where a panel went undrawn), `ink` (an array of three
  flat panel arrays), `mine` (your current vote, -1 = none), `deadline`/`dur`.
- `"vote"`: `sheets` (`n`/`who`/`votes`), `mine`, `deadline`/`dur`.
- `"final"`: `best` (sheet index), `votes`, `who`, `board` (the shared leaderboard).

**Memory.** Sheets live in a fixed array sized for the worst case
(`HA_MAX_PLAYERS` sheets x 3 panels x 64 segments x 4 bytes ~= 10 KB of `.bss`) and are
never grown; a panel simply stops recording ink once it is full, and the client only
sends a segment once the pen has actually travelled, so that budget is a doodle's worth.
Saving is streamed through the `ART` report as the gallery walks the sheets, a segment at
a time, so keeping the pictures costs no additional RAM on either side.
