**Offline multiplayer party games hosted from a Flipper Zero + ESP32-S2 WiFi board.**
No internet, no app install. You host an open WiFi network from the Flipper; people
nearby join it, a captive page hands them into a game in their phone browser, and
everyone plays together over the local network. Built for dead zones: buses, planes,
subways, campsites, anywhere with no signal.

The Flipper is the **game master**: it shows the lobby and live scoreboard and drives
the rounds. The ESP32 board is the **referee**: it runs the WiFi access point, serves
the game to phones, and keeps the real-time game state. See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Ten games, all phone-driven. Pick your emoji avatar on the way in and fire off emoji
reactions that float up on everyone's screen mid-game.

**Whole-group** (scale to everyone in the room, ready-up lobby, shared live leaderboard):

- **Trivia** — Kahoot-style and fully self-organizing. Players ready up and vote a topic
  in the lobby; an all-ready 5-second countdown starts it; phones buzz in A/B/C/D with
  points for correct and fast; a collapsible leaderboard rides along and a podium ends
  it. Topics are the trivia packs on the SD card.
- **Would You Rather** — a live A/B poll; tap your pick, watch the split reveal. Prompts
  are the wyr packs on the SD card, votable in the lobby.
- **Word Scramble** — unscramble the word and type it first; fastest correct scores most.
  Words are the scramble packs on the SD card, votable in the lobby.
- **Reaction Duel** — fastest finger: wait for green, tap first to win, false-start and
  you're out for the round.

**1v1 duels** (challenge a player, many matches at once, rematch button, wins score on
the Flipper leaderboard):

- **Connect Four**, **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Dots & Boxes**, **Reversi/Othello**.
- **Pong** — real-time rally with on-screen paddles.

**Cooperative-ish:**

- **Drawing & guessing** — one player draws on their phone canvas, everyone else guesses
  in a chat; points for the drawer and the first correct guess; rounds rotate the drawer.
  Words are the draw packs on the SD card (no vote strip — the first pack streamed is
  the one played).

All games run on one pluggable engine on the ESP (the real-time referee), and the web
client shares one implementation of the lobby, countdown, timer, leaderboard, and podium,
so adding a game is mostly a small module on each side.

## Screenshots

**On the Flipper** — the host device shows the app menu, the live broadcasting dashboard
(join info + players + active game + event feed), and the game selector on its 1-bit screen.
Every game is phone-driven, so the Flipper just selects the game and watches the feed:

## Hardware

- **Flipper Zero** (developed on **Momentum** firmware; other forks work with a matching
  `ufbt` SDK).
- **Official Flipper WiFi Dev Board (ESP32-S2)** — mounts on the GPIO header, wiring the
  two together over UART.

## How it works

```
 Phones (browser)  <-- WebSocket -->  ESP32-S2  <-- UART 921600 -->  Flipper Zero
   play the game                     AP + web + referee              host / scoreboard
```

- The ESP hosts an **open AP + wildcard DNS + catch-all web server**, so joining the
  WiFi pops a captive page on every phone.
- The captive page hands off to the game web app at `http://192.168.4.1` (captive
  mini-browsers are too limited for WebSockets, so it is a "tap to open in your browser"
  handoff).
- The Flipper streams the (gzipped) web bundle and trivia content to the ESP over a
  framed UART protocol, then orchestrates rounds. Real-time game traffic stays on the
  ESP and never crosses the slow UART. Protocol: [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Install

**You only need `hotspot_arcade.fap`.** Grab it from the
[latest release](https://github.com/tarikbc/hotspot-arcade/releases/latest) and drop it in
`/ext/apps/GPIO/` on the SD card (qFlipper, or the Flipper's own file manager). No SD
setup, no separate downloads: the ESP firmware, the phone game bundle, and the trivia
packs all ship inside the .fap.

> **First launch takes a few seconds.** The .fap carries ~850 KB of bundled content and
> the Flipper unpacks it to the SD card the first time you open the app (and again after
> an update). The hourglass is the system loader doing that, not a hang. Every launch
> after that is instant.

Then, on the Flipper: **Apps → GPIO → [ESP32] Hotspot Arcade**.

### Flashing the ESP board (no computer)

The app embeds Espressif's `esp-serial-flasher` and carries the ESP firmware, so the board
is flashed from the Flipper itself: use **Install Firmware** in the main menu, or accept
the prompt the lobby shows when it doesn't see a board (or sees one on older firmware).
Put the ESP in download mode when asked (**hold BOOT, tap RESET, release BOOT**); it
verifies with MD5, then asks you to **tap RESET** to boot the new firmware, and continues
on its own once the board comes back.

Prefer a computer? `firmware-merged.bin` on the release flashes at `0x0` with esptool
(**never `--erase-all` on the S2**).

### Custom content

The bundled web bundle and trivia packs live in `/ext/apps_assets/hotspot_arcade/`, which
the loader rewrites from the .fap on every launch. To add your own, use
`/ext/apps_data/hotspot_arcade/` instead, which is never touched:

- `packs/<game>/*.txt` — your packs are offered alongside the bundled ones (yours win a
  name clash). One directory per game, e.g. `packs/trivia/`.
- `web/` — a `manifest.json` here replaces the bundled game client entirely.

## Build from source

Full commands and gotchas are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); the short version:

**1. Web bundle** (Node)
```sh
cd web && node build.mjs        # -> web/dist/{index.html.gz, manifest.json}
```

**2. ESP32-S2 firmware** (arduino-cli, esp32 core 2.0.17, vendored libs in `esp32/libs`)
```sh
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s2:PartitionScheme=huge_app \
  --libraries esp32/libs --output-dir esp32/hotspot-arcade-fw/build esp32/hotspot-arcade-fw
```

**3. Flipper app** — use the wrapper, not bare `ufbt`: it refreshes the bundled firmware
images, web bundle, and trivia packs inside `assets/` before packaging.
```sh
tools/build-fap.sh                         # -> dist/hotspot_arcade.fap
python3 tools/deploy-to-flipper.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodemflip_XXXX
```
The deploy script pushes the fap to `/ext/apps/GPIO/` and your working copies of the web
bundle and trivia packs to `/ext/apps_data/hotspot_arcade/`, where they override the
bundled ones — so you can iterate on the web client without rebuilding the fap.

## Usage

On the Flipper: **Apps → GPIO → [ESP32] Hotspot Arcade**.

1. **Set the SSID** (optional). Trivia packs are picked up automatically.
2. **Start Session** — the ESP brings up the AP; the dashboard shows **Broadcasting**.
3. People **join the WiFi** and open `192.168.4.1`, pick a nickname, and land in the lobby.
4. **Games** → pick a game. Everything is player-driven from the phones: the whole-group
   games (Trivia, Would You Rather, Word Scramble, Reaction Duel) self-run once players ready
   up; the duels (Connect Four / Tic-Tac-Toe / Dots & Boxes / Reversi), **Drawing**, and
   **Pong** organize themselves too. The dashboard **Feed** watches events.
5. **Leaderboard** shows live scores; **Console** shows the raw event log.

## Trivia packs

Plain-text files, one directory per game under `packs/` (`Key: value` lines, blocks split
by `---` or a blank line, `Pack:` names the pack). Trivia's keys are `Q:`, `A:`-`D:` and
`Answer:`. Three packs ship inside the .fap; drop your own into
`/ext/apps_data/hotspot_arcade/packs/trivia/` to add to them. See
[packs/README.md](packs/README.md).

## Responsible use

Hotspot Arcade runs an **open** WiFi access point and a captive page that serves a game.
It is for fun and learning on your own hardware, among people who want to play. Running
an open AP may be restricted in some places (e.g. on aircraft, or where it could
interfere) — only operate it where that is allowed. It captures no credentials and
serves only the bundled game.

## Layout

```
flipper/hotspot-arcade/   Flipper app (C, ufbt/Momentum) — host + scoreboard
esp32/hotspot-arcade-fw/  ESP32-S2 firmware (Arduino) — AP + web + WebSocket referee
esp32/libs/               vendored AsyncTCP + ESPAsyncWebServer
web/                      phone game client (vanilla JS, gzipped bundle)
packs/                    content packs, one dir per game (trivia today)
tools/deploy-to-flipper.py
docs/                     ARCHITECTURE.md, PROTOCOL.md
```

Sibling project to flytrap, which this reuses the AP/captive-portal plumbing and
Flipper UART patterns from.
